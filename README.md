# Mean Girls App

## Midterm Agile Team Project for Skill Distillery

### Description
This is a web app that allows the user to role-play as a "Mean Girls" character from the totally fetch 2004 movie starring Lindsay Lohan. The user can make a profile and then create multiple Mean Girls characters. Acting as a character, the user can join cliques (if they are cool enough... ), post on a general cafeteria bulletin board, write totally mean comments about others in the Burn Book, and vote on how fetch other characters' comments are. Will you totally make "fetch" a thing? Will your hair be big and full of secrets? Will you wear pink on Wednesdays? Then get in loser, we're going to the mall.

- Eric:
  * This was a great opportunity to practice some debugging skills, pair programming, and full stack development. In the immortal words of David Thomas and Andrew Hunt, "Read the damn error message!"
  * I learned a lot about front-end development and Bootstrap (which has historically been a weaness of mine).
  * It doesn't matter who wrote the bug... chip in and fix it! Everyone will break the development branch from time to time, and trying to find who is to blame is a waste of time.

- Karen:
  * This was an amazing experience, i definitely feel more confortable working in code with other people and i got to practice pair programming.  
  * I gained more experience with MVC and CSS.
  * At first working in with Agile Methodologies was not that easy but we learned how to work as a team and we did an amazing job.
